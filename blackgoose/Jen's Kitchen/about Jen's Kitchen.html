<h1>About Jen&rsquo;s Kitchen </h1>

<p>The recipes listed here are ones that I have developed myself. In some cases, I started with a recipe found in a cookbook or magazine, but over time, I've adapted it enough to call it my own. <i>Bon Appetit!</i></p>
<p>The site also includes links to my favorite online cooking resources. One day, I hope to include a section of restaurant reviews.</p>
<p>If you have recommendations, feel free to email me at jen@example.com.</p>
